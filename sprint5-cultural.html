          <h1>Foundations Core Skills</h1>
            <h2>Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.</h2>
            <p>
                I would say that the core learning has allowed me to be more open to judgement. It has let me known what my limitations are. It helped 
                me to understand the importance of EQ and how big of a impact it has on job opportunities. I feel that I can better my learning plan now 
                that I've had a chance to experience first hand what the courses may entail. I have a mentality of "If I can't do it now, I can learn how 
                to do it" it just might take a bit of time. Thinking like a programmer I felt was one of the biggest lessons I took from. I got a good working 
                system from it. Basically; to plan HOW I'm going to solve it, break down the task into manageable steps, pushing myself through the challenge, 
                if I am still struggling then I'd reach out to coding communities.           
             </p>
            <h2>What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                I learnt how resistant I am to reaching out for help, which is good that I can identify that. And I have been reaching out for help more than
                 I normally would. I also learnt when I need to take a break. Probably one of the most important things that I've learnt is that. I usually like 
                 to attack a problem and just keep going until it's solved. (which, now that I think about it, must be common) But in doing so, my brain gets 
                 all full and I it's not worth trying. So I take a tiny break and back into it and hey presto, finding all the mistakes I made.
            </p>
            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                For me, learning about emotional intelligence was probably the most surprising topic to learn about. I didn't realise how much study and 
                research went into EQ. Reading into it has me wanting to buy the book where it was first talked about. The surprising thing to me was how 
                big of a role it plays when being in a leadership position. It makes you think that all leaders and managers should have a firm grasp of EQ 
                because it will help them in understanding their peers and employees which ultimately will better the job for everyone.
            </p>
            <h2>What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Funny enough, the most challenging part about the core learning was for me to "indentify" myself. It's easy to research and read about others 
                but when I was reading into myself, I had a tough time. It was more letting myself be open to myself and really figure out the good and the bad 
                about me. In doing so however, it's opened my mind to the limitations that I can work on.
