                    HTML is basically the initial structure of the website. It lays down the foundations and
                     attributes of what the website is intended for. In a painting, we can say that not only 
                     the canvas will be acting as the “container” for the painting but also the working lines 
                     and rough sketches before adding details.

            <p>And left alone this painting can look quite boring. Well, it’s not even a painting yet. That’s 
                where CSS comes in. CSS acts as our “paint” or “decoration” that adds flare and alters what the 
                overall design actually looks like. CSS turns a standard HTML page into a website more visually 
                appealing like this.

                    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or

              </h2>
              <p>
                    The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. You utilize loops and 
                    control statements to setup the order of execution. Say for example, you’re figuring out what you’re gonna wear 
                    for the day. I’d first think “Am I going out today?” if not then I’d just wear home clothes. Else if I am then 
                    I’d look outside or check my weather forecast to see what they day is gonna look like. If it looks like it’s gonna
                     be a hot day, then I would wear nothing too heavy. If it looks like it’s gonna pour down, I’d consider bringing a
                      rain jacket and so on.
                    <br>
                    That example was basically a loop. It used if statements and checks to come to a conclusion on what 
                    to wear according to the day!

              <h2>
                    Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
              </h2>
              <p>
                    Document Object Model, (or as the tech kids say, “DOM”) is an application programming interface for HTML.
                     It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. DOM 
                     expresses the HTML document as a tree like a family tree with parents and children.
              </p>
              <img src="sprint3-technical-pictures/DOM-tree.png" alt="picture of logic tree">
              <p class="lead">
                    Every element on the tree is called a node.
              </p>
              <p>
                    DOM allows you to interact with the nodes. For example, you can:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Access each node</li>
                  <li>Modify each node</li>
                  <li>Identify a node</li>
                  <li>Retrieve different nodes you want to edit</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>
                Array
            </h3>
            <p>
                    An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at
                     a time like a list. An array can hold many values under a single name, 
                     and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

            <h3>
                Object
            </h3>
            <p>
                    An object is a collection of related data or functions . An object stores 
                    data by keys and each key gets given a name that you assign to it. So to access the 
                    data for that key you would reference the object’s name and then the key name to 
                    return the data to you. For example 
                    <b>myObject.myKey</b>
            </p>

              </h2>
              <p>
                    A function is code that can execute a procedure that you’ve assigned to it. The reason
                     why they are used so much is that it can take a long list of instructions and distill
                      it into one command to be called upon and executed.
