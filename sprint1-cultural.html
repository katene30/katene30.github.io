              In my last year of highschool I was approached by two young girls on seperate accounts where they explained to me about their current position in home life. Both of which were depressed and had severe anxiety. They were not comfortable in opening up or talking to the councillor because they didn’t feel comfortable or safe with talking to her. When they were explaining to me how dangerous the situation at home was getting it was a no brainer to get involved. I came to a crossroad for an ethical decision I had to make. I had to weigh up between maintaining the trust between us or manage the risk. I followed on to seek third party support because of the severity of the situation. In doing so, the consequence was a breach of trust but I maintained privacy and confidence between the girls. Following on from that, I still continue to communicate with and them monitor them. These caring values I have adopted will mainly be from my culture. As Maori is a very whanau orientated culture, nurturing one another makes Manaakitanga second nature for me. “He aha te mea nui o te ao. He tangata, he tanagata, he tangata.” That was my first whakatauki I learnt and it has resonated with me ever since. The most important thing in the world. It is people, it is people, it is people.” I believe that I should not only care about myself, but put the time and effort into caring for others.

              In evaluating my strengths I can conclude that when I do look into something new I will learn as much of it as I can. Often which leads to a limitation, I get so consumed in it, that I can lose that initial focus. I am always eager to learn new things and I love talking to people. A strong part of career development that I have found is the communication. I feel that it is important to have great communication skills and are able to conversate in every given situation. I feel that you must be approachable and able to adapt in career development. Whilst evaluating my limitations that I need to work on, I discovered that I do it find it difficult to stay focused at times. According to a personality test when it comes to conceiving ideas and starting projects, especially involving other people, Campaigners (Me being what they call a “campaigner”) have exceptional talent. Unfortunately their skill with upkeep, administration, and follow-through on those projects struggles. In which I agree with this statement. I feel that being a proactive communicator would help me to reach out whenever in need of help. I feel that I am very able to ask the right questions at the right time when I am to encounter learning obstacles.
